Welcome to the official Ivy documentation.

<h1>What is Ivy?</h1>
Ivy is an agile dependency manager, primarily focused on managing java dependencies.
Ivy is open source and released under a very permissive <a href="license.html">BSD license</a>.
Ivy has a lot of powerful <a href="features.html">features</a>, the most popular and useful being its flexibily, integration with ant, and its strong transitive dependencies management engine.
The transitive dependencies management is a feature which let you get dependencies of your dependencies, transitively. In order to address this problematic ivy needs to find metadata about your modules, usually in an <a href="doc/ivyfile.html">ivy file</a>. To find these metadata and your dependencies artifacts (usually jars), Ivy can be configured to use a lot of different <a href="doc/configuration/resolvers.html">repositories</a>.

<h1>About this doc</h1>
If you browse this documentation from your installation of ivy, you can also check the <a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/ivy/doc">online version</a> for latest updates and comments. To easily navigate to the online version, you will find a link to the corresponding online version on each page just after the title.

The online version of this documentation is updated periodically, especially when new features are added during development. So if you find something documented here not available in your version of ivy, it may be because it is available only with the latest <a href="download.html">download</a>.

If you want to view the whole documentation in a single printer-friendly page, please use the <a href="doc/print.html">printer-friendly link</a> at the bottom of any documentation page in the online documentation.

<h1>Overview</h1>
This documentation is decomposed in 3 main parts:
<ul>
  <li><a href="doc/tutorial.html">Tutorials</a></li> 
The tutorials is the best way to begin to play with ivy. You will easily and quickly learn the basics of Ivy.
  <li><a href="doc/reference.html">Reference</a></li> 
The reference documentation gives you all the details of Ivy. 
The introduction part is particularly useful: it defines some vocabulary, explains main concepts such as dependency resolvers and patterns, and give an overview on how ivy works internally. 
It's also in the reference doc that you will find all you always dreamed to know about ivy configuration, ivy files, and ivy use (especially with ant).
  <li><a href="doc/appendix.html">Appendix</a></li> 
The appendix section contains a bunch of Ivy related information which is not part of Ivy reference doc.

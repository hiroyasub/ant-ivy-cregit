Includes another ivyconf file as if it were part of this one. <span class="since">since 1.3</span>

The included ivyconf file has to be a complete well formed ivyconf file, i.e. it does have to include the <code><ivyconf></code> tag.

<table class="ivy-attributes">

<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
<ivyconf>
  <property name="myrepository" value="path/to/my/real/rep"/>
  <conf defaultResolver="default"/>
  <include file="path/to/ivyconf-default.xml"/>
</ivyconf>
</code>
with ivyconf-default.xml:
<code type="xml">
<ivyconf>
  <property name="myrepository" value="path/to/rep" overwrite="false"/>
  <resolvers>
    <ivyrep name="default" ivyroot="${myrepository}"/>
  </resolvers>
</ivyconf>
</code>

The included ivyconf defines a resolver named default, which is an ivyrep resolver, with its root configured as being the value of myrepository variable. This variable is given the value path/to/rep in the included file, but because the attribute overwrite is set to false, it will not overide the value given in the main ivyconf including this one, so the value used for myrepository will be path/to/my/real/rep.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
<ivyconf>
  <include file="ivyconf-macro.xml"/>
  <resolvers>
    <mymacro name="includeworks" mymainrep="included/myrep" mysecondrep="included/secondrep"/>
  </resolvers>
</ivyconf> 
</code>
with ivyconf-macro.xml being the ivyconf example given on the <a href="../../doc/configuration/macrodef.html">macrodef documentation page</a>.
This let reusing macro resolver easy.

Sets a variable (by name and value), or set of variables (from file or url) in ivy. <br/>
Variables are case sensitive.<br/><br/>
Contrary to ant properties, ivy variables are mutable. But a problem with this is that you do not control when 
variables are substituted, and usually it is done as soon as possible. So changing the value of a variable will
have no effect if it has already been substituted. Consequently, <b>using this task is NOT recommended</b>.
See <a href="../../doc/reference.html">reference</a> page for details about ivy variables.

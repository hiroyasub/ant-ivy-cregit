Constructs an ant fileset consisting of artifacts in ivy cache for a configuration (<span class="since">since 1.2</span>).<br/><br/>
This is a <a href="../../doc/use/postresolvetask.html">post resolve task</a>, with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks. Note that this task
does not rely on retrieve, because built fileset is made of artifacts direcly in ivy cache.<br/><br/>
Please prefer the use of retrieve + standard ant path creation, which make your build
more independent from ivy (once artifacts are properly retrieved, ivy is not required any more).<br/><br/>
Built fileset is registered in ant with a given id, and can thus be used like any other ant fileset using
refid.

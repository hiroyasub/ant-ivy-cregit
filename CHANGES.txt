              with previous versions

- ant properties are now available in ivyconf file
- unified default properties in ivyconf, with better independance from url or file
- added ext on artifacts: this enable to distinguish artifact extension from artifact
  type, util in cases where it differs (example: 'src' type with 'zip' extension, 'ivy' type with 'xml' extension, ...)
- added publish artifacts feature, which enable to publish declared artifacts of a module to a repository
  described by a dependency resolver. It currently works only with filesystem resolver.
- url resolver now handles latest with file urls and http ones (tested only with apache server)

  is now configurable on resolvers handling latest. 
- added parameter on chain resolver to say if it should return first found or
  try to find the latest among all if asked
- a module can now publish no artifact, useful for virtual modules consisting only
  of integration of other modules

  and thus not downloaded

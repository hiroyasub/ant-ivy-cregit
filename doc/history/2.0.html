The 2.0 version will be the first stable version released at Apache.

Most of the efforts of the development team is concentrated on this version, and a [[history/2.0.0-alpha-1 first alpha]] version is available for early preview.

Despite the version name, the 2.0 version will be mostly backward compatible with prior 1.x versions. Indeed we choose to use a major version number change to reflect the change in the Ivy API which has been deeply revisited, and our migration to the Apache Software Foundation. But from a user point of view, Ivy 2.0 will be mostly a drop in replacement of the previous 1.x versions.</textarea>

Ivy has not yet released a version under the Apache Incubator. Previous releases can be considered production quality, but are not endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation.

What you can get here at the ASF is the latest sources from the Subversion repository:
<code>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/trunk ivy
</code>
There is also a snapshot build available here at the ASF, with the new package names (for those who use the Ivy API). It should not be considered production quality, is not a release, and is not fully endorsed by the ASF. If after all these warnings you're still interested, here is the link:
http://incubator.apache.org/ivy/downloads/latest/

The latest stable version of Ivy is <a href="doc/releasenotes/1.4.1.html">1.4.1</a>, and is not an Apache incubating release, but a release done while Ivy was still hosted by jayasoft:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jaya.free.fr/downloads/ivy/1.4.1/ivy-1.4.1-bin.zip">binaries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jaya.free.fr/downloads/ivy/1.4.1/ivy-1.4.1-src.zip">sources</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jaya.free.fr/downloads/ivy/1.4.1/ivy-1.4.1-doc.zip">documentation</a></li>
</ul>

To have a quick overview of some of the changes in this version, check the <a href="doc/releasenotes/1.4.html">1.4.1 release notes</a> page.

You can also download ivy jar and ivy.xml alone directly from the jayasoft site (useful especially for easy ant setup) using the following pattern:
http://www.jayasoft.org/downloads/ivy/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]

This is used to auto install Ivy from internet, in the <a href="doc/tutorial.html">first tutorial</a>. Take a look at these examples if you want such an auto install feature in your own builds.
The xsd for ivy files of the version is also available online at:
http://www.jayasoft.org/downloads/ivy/[revision]/ivy.xsd

To have info about the different kind of distributions, see <a href="choose-distrib.html">that page</a>.
For previous version information and download, see the <a href="doc/releasenotes.html">release notes page</a> in the documentation.</textarea>

Ivy has not yet released a version under the Apache Incubator. Previous releases can be considered production quality, but are not endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation.

<h2>Building from source</h2>
What you can get here at the ASF is the latest sources from the Subversion repository:
<code>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/trunk ivy
</code>
Then to build Ivy from source, assuming you have ant 1.6.2+ and a jdk 1.4+ installed, then you only need to run the following command:
<code>
ant jar
</code>
Then you will find ivy.jar in <b>build/artifact</b>.

<h2>Snapshot build</h2>
There is also a snapshot build available here at the ASF, with the new package names (for those who use the Ivy API). It should not be considered production quality, is not a release, and is not fully endorsed by the ASF. If after all these warnings you're still interested, here is the link:
http://incubator.apache.org/ivy/downloads/latest/

<h2>Latest stable version (not Apache)</h2>
The latest stable version of Ivy is <a href="doc/releasenotes/1.4.1.html">1.4.1</a>, and is not an Apache incubating release, but a release done while Ivy was still hosted by jayasoft:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jaya.free.fr/downloads/ivy/1.4.1/ivy-1.4.1-bin.zip">binaries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jaya.free.fr/downloads/ivy/1.4.1/ivy-1.4.1-src.zip">sources</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jaya.free.fr/downloads/ivy/1.4.1/ivy-1.4.1-doc.zip">documentation</a></li>
</ul>

To have a quick overview of some of the changes in this version, check the <a href="doc/releasenotes/1.4.html">1.4.1 release notes</a> page.

You can also download ivy jar and ivy.xml alone directly from the jayasoft site (useful especially for easy ant setup) using the following pattern:
http://www.jayasoft.org/downloads/ivy/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]

This is used to auto install Ivy from internet, in the <a href="doc/tutorial.html">first tutorial</a>. Take a look at these examples if you want such an auto install feature in your own builds.
The xsd for ivy files of the version is also available online at:
http://www.jayasoft.org/downloads/ivy/[revision]/ivy.xsd

To have info about the different kind of distributions, see <a href="choose-distrib.html">that page</a>.
For previous version information and download, see the <a href="doc/releasenotes.html">release notes page</a> in the documentation.</textarea>

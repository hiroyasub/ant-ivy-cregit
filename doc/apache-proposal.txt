= Ivy Proposal =

This proposal outlines the creation of a new Ivy project within the Apache Software Foundation.

== Status ==
This is only a draft proposal and is not intended to be submitted as is to the ASF

== Abstract ==
Ivy is a flexible dependency manager.

== Proposal ==
Ivy is a very flexible dependency manager with a tight integration with Apache Ant. It allows to resolve project dependencies, including transitive dependencies, with a strong focus on flexibility and control over what's happening. Even if Ivy can be used as a standalone program, it is generally used as a set of ant tasks, ranging from dependency resolution to reports about dependencies or module publishing.

== Rationale ==

There is strong need for tools helping software reuse in the java development community. Ivy tackles this problematic in a very flexible way, very suitable to Ant users.
It is often compared to maven ant tasks, but has some strong differences like the ability to define several artifacts in one module, or more flexibility in the repository configuration or conflict management. 

The maintainers of Ivy are interested in joining the Apache Software Foundation for several reasons:
    * Ivy has been hosted since its beginning in 2004 by a private company, which make people feel like it's a corporate product, thus slowing the contribution by the community. We strongly believe in the open source movement, and would like to make Ivy independent from Jayasoft.
    * We'd like to enjoy the benefits of utilizing Apache's infrastructure and legal protection.
    * It might open the door for cooperation with other projects, such as Ant or Maven.
    * We strongly believe in Apache philosophy, especially Meritocracy.

== Current status ==
=== Meritocracy ===

Ivy was originally created by Xavier Hanin in September 2004. Since then more than 20 users have contributed patches, and one of them has been promoted to the status of committer based on his merit through patch contribution.

=== Community ===

Ivy already has a growing user community, with more than 10,000 downloads since its 1.0 version and more than 500 users registered on the forum.

=== Core Developers ===

Ivy has only two core developers for the moment, but we hope joining the ASF will help increase this number.

Xavier Hanin is the creator of the project, is an independant consultant and co founder of Jayasoft.
Maarten Coene has joined the committer team in may 2006.

=== Alignment ===

Ivy has no mandatory dependencies except java 1.4. However, it is strongly recommended to be used with Ant. Ivy uses also other Apache projects, especially from Jakarta Commons.

== Known risks ==

=== Orphaned products ===
Due to its small number of committers, there is a risk of being orphaned. The main knowledge of the codebase is still mainly owned by Xavier Hanin. Even if Xavier has no plan to leave Ivy development, this is a problem we are aware of and know that need to be worked on so that the project become less dependent on an individual.

=== Inexperience with Open Source ===
The main participation in open source projects has been on Ivy itself. Even if Ivy now has more than two years, it started as a not so open project, with no public access to the issue tracking system nor the svn repository. Things have changed since then, the svn repository is publicly accessible and a JIRA instance has been setup since june 2005. Many new features are first discussed on the forum or JIRA, but the education with true open source development is also something that need to improved during the incubation.

=== Homogenous Developers ===
With only two core developers, at least they are not homogenous! Xavier and Maarten knew each other only due to their common interest in Ivy.

=== Reliance on Salaried Developers ===
Maarten is not paid to work on Ivy.
Xavier's case is more complex, as a co founder of Jayasoft, part of his time in Jayasoft was dedicated to Ivy and other open source developments. He now works mainly as an independent consultant, and thus is not a salaried developer.

=== Relationships with Other Apache Products ===
Ivy has a strong relationship with Apache Ant, and is often seen as a good companion of Ant. Being part of Apache could help for a closer collaboration between the two projects.

=== A Excessive Fascination with the Apache Brand ===
Even if we recognize the strong value of the Apache Brand, the purpose of joining Apache is not focused on improving the visibility of the project. The main focus of this proposition is to make Ivy a more open project, with a closer integration with Apache Ant. Even if Ivy does not join the ASF, Ivy will move out of Jayasoft umbrella and try to attract more developers. 

== Documentation ==
Further reading on Ivy can be found at:
http://www.jayasoft.org/ivy

== Initial Source ==
The initial code base can be found at:
http://svn.jayasoft.org/projects/tools/ivy

== External Dependencies ==
Ivy has no mandatory dependencies at runtime. 

For compilation, it requires:
apache ant
apache commons-httpclient
apache commons-cli
apache oro
apache commons-vfs
jcraft jsch  (BSD, already used by commons-vfs and by ant)

== Required Resources ==

=== Mailing lists ===
 * ivy-private (with moderated subscriptions) 
 * ivy-dev 
 * ivy-user
 
=== Subversion Directory ===
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy

=== Issue Tracking ===
JIRA Ivy (IVY) 
An import from existing JIRA issues at http://jira.jayasoft.org/ would also be very much appreciated

== Initial Committers ==
Xavier Hanin (xavier dot hanin at gmail dot com)
Maarten Coene (maarten_coene at yahoo dot com)

== Affiliations ==
As stated in the Reliance on salaried developers section, Xavier is a co founder of Jayasoft which used to host the project. However, Jayasoft is shifting its focus to local consulting and thus won't be involved anymore in open source development. The participation of Xavier in the project is thus made as an individual, not as a member of Jayasoft. He also strongly believe in the meritocracy principle, and he's ready to see it applied to the project whatever the consequence are for his own weight in the project.

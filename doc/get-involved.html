As an Apache Incubator project, Ivy is very open to external contributions.

There are many ways to contribute to Ivy.

First, [[download]] and use it, subscribe to the [[mailing-lists]], and answer to other user questions. You can also browse [[issues jira issues]], vote for the one you are most interested in, add your comments and feedback. You can also very easily contribute to the [[wiki]].

When you browse the documentation, whenever you see something that could be improved, feel free to edit it and provide a documentation patch. It's very easy if you browse the documentation offline (in the doc directory if you check out Ivy from svn), you will see a small toolbar at the upper left of the page, which allows you to edit the page. Then all you have to do is attach your modification as a patch to a new issue in JIRA.

You can also provide brand new documentation pages, tutorials, demo, or even links to a tutorial on your own blog. 

Another useful way to contribute is to spread the word: if you like Ivy, say it! On your blog, on other blog comments, on popular java related sites, wherever. The more Ivy is popular, the more it will get external contributions, and the better it will be, for the benefit of the whole community.

When you get more confident with Ivy, you can check it out from svn, and begin to see if there are issues you could fix or implement, and provide patches to make the whole community benefit from your work.

When you provide a patch, to increase the chance to get integrated, do not forget to provide a junit test, and a patch to the documentation if it changes anything in Ivy behaviour.

And if you often provide patches and answers on the mailing lists, you may get the chance to become a commiter, with write access to the svn repository!</textarea>

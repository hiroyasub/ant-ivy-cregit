*Tag:* settings

Configures some important ivy info: default resolver, latest strategy, conflict manager...

The default resolver is used whenever nothing else is configured in the modules section of the settings file. It should give the name of a dependency resolver defined in the link:../settings/resolvers.html[resolvers] section of the settings file.

The default latest strategy and conflict manager can also be configured here.

_validate_ indicates if ivy files should generally be validated against the xsd or not. This setting is only a default value, and can be overridden:
1) in ant tasks
2) in resolvers
So if there is a setting in the resolver, it always wins against all other settings.

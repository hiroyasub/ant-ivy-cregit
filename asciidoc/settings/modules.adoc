= modules

*Tag:* modules

Defines per module or module set settings.

The rules are given by defining a module set, using a pattern for module organisation and name, and giving some settings for the set, like the name of the corresponding resolver to use.

If no rules match a given module, the default setting will be used.

NOTE: You can greatly improve the performance of dependency resolution by configuring multiple smaller resolvers instead of one large resolver (i.e. chain). For instance, if you have a local repository for your modules and a remote repository for third party libraries, it is a good idea to have two separate resolvers, one for all of your modules and another for the rest (the default one).

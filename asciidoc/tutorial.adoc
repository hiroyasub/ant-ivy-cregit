The best way to learn is to practice! That's what the Ivy tutorials will help you to do, to discover some of the great Ivy link:https://ant.apache.org/ivy/features.html[features].

For the first tutorial you won't even have to install Ivy (assuming you have Ant and a JDK properly installed), and it shouldn't take more than 30 seconds.

*First Tutorial*


. Make sure you have link:http://ant.apache.org/[ant] 1.9.9 or greater and a link:http://java.sun.com[jdk] properly installed +

. Copy link:samples/build.xml[this build file] in an empty directory on your local filesystem (and make sure you name it build.xml) +

. Open a console in this directory and run "ant". That's it! +

If you have any trouble, check the link:http://ant.apache.org/ivy/faq.html[FAQ]. It is most likely related to your internet connection (proxy anyone?).

OK, you've just seen how easy it is to take your first step with Ivy. Go ahead with the other tutorials, but before you do, make sure you have properly link:install.html[installed] Ivy and downloaded the tutorials sources (included in all Ivy distributions, in the `link:https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=ant-ivy.git;a=tree;f=src/example[src/example]` directory).

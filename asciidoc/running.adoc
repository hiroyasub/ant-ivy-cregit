    Ivy is sending http headers when downloading files.
    The User-Agent http header can be controlled using a

system property.
    When this system property is not set, the default value for the User-Agent header is "Apache Ivy/ivyversion"
    where ivyversion is replaced by the currently running version of ivy.
